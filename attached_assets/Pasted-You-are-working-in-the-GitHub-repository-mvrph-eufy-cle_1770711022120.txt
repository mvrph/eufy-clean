You are working in the GitHub repository mvrph/eufy-clean, which contains a Home Assistant
custom integration for controlling Eufy vacuums over MQTT (Robovac X10 Pro Omni).

Goal:
- Organize and streamline the repository so it is easier to navigate and maintain.
- Prepare changes as if they will be submitted as a single pull request.

High-level objectives:
- Make the repo layout more discoverable for new contributors.
- Ensure configuration, services, and MQTT topics are clearly documented near the code that uses them.
- Tighten up duplicated or scattered documentation (e.g. README vs docs/*) without losing information.

Constraints:
- Do not make any behavior-changing edits to the integration logic unless absolutely necessary to fix
  an obvious bug. Prefer documentation, structure, and naming improvements.
- Do not change public-facing service names, entity IDs, or configuration options.
- Keep the Home Assistant integration structure compatible with current versions of Home Assistant.
- If you are unsure about a behavior change, leave a clear TODO comment instead of changing the code.

Allowed changes:
- Reorganize folders (e.g. move helpers/utilities into subpackages) as long as imports are updated.
- Add or update module-level docstrings to explain responsibilities.
- Improve type hints and inline comments where they clarify behavior.
- Normalize naming for modules, classes, and functions when it improves clarity but does not
  change behavior.
- Add or update documentation (README, TODO, docs/*) to reflect the new structure.

README / docs expectations:
- Ensure the top-level README reflects the organized layout:
  - Where to find core integration code.
  - Where MQTT/topic handling lives.
  - Where configuration schemas and validation live.
  - Where tests (if any) live and how to run them.
- Keep examples and configuration snippets accurate with respect to the current code.

Safety checks:
- If there are tests or linters configured, run them and fix only clearly non-behavioral issues
  (e.g. import paths after moving files, obvious typos).
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless they are already used elsewhere in your changes.

PR preparation:
- Think of your final result as a single pull request named something like "Organize eufy-clean layout".
- At the end of your work, write a concise PR title and body that explain:
  - What you changed structurally.
  - Any risk to existing users (should be minimal).
  - How you verified that the integration still works (tests, manual checks, or reasoning).
- Output your final answer in the following exact format so it can be parsed by automation:
  PR_TITLE: <a single-line title for the pull request>
  PR_BODY:
  <a multi-line markdown body suitable for a GitHub pull request description>

Steps:
1. Scan the current repo structure and identify the main entry points for the integration.
2. Propose a target layout in your own words before making changes.
3. Apply non-breaking structural and documentation improvements incrementally.
4. Keep notes of the changes you make so they can be summarized in the PR body.
5. Finish by emitting PR_TITLE and PR_BODY as described above, and briefly list the key changes.
