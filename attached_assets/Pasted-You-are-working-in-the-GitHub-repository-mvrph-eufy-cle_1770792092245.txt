You are working in the GitHub repository mvrph/eufy-clean, which contains a Home Assistant custom
integration for controlling Eufy vacuums over MQTT (Robovac X10 Pro Omni).

Goal:
- Clean up and reorganize the top-level README for this project.
- Improve clarity, structure, and consistency.
- Do NOT make any logic or behavioral code changes — documentation-only.

Constraints:
- Do not modify Python, YAML, or Home Assistant integration logic.
- You may only edit documentation files (README, TODO, docs/*) and non-code assets if needed.
- Preserve all existing features and configuration semantics; do not rename services, fields, or options.
- Keep examples accurate relative to the current code.

README requirements:
- Keep the README focused on:
  - What the integration is and which devices it targets.
  - Installation paths: HACS (Home Assistant) and standalone Python usage.
  - Configuration and common usage examples (scene cleaning, room cleaning, battery sensor).
  - Project structure and where to look in the code.
  - Roadmap / TODO and credits.
- Reorganize sections for readability following a template similar in spirit to my default_skeleton
  repositories:
  1. Title + one-paragraph overview
  2. Features
  3. Installation (HACS + standalone)
  4. Configuration / Usage (Home Assistant services, scenes, rooms, tips)
  5. Development notes (project structure)
  6. Roadmap / TODO
  7. License and Credits
- Use clear section headings (##, ###) and consistent markdown style.
- Keep all existing information, but you may:
  - Rewrite sentences for clarity.
  - Move content between sections.
  - Add short context where something is unclear.

Steps:
1. Open the current README in this repo and read it fully.
2. Open the default_skeleton repository README on GitHub just to understand the general style and
   section ordering I like. Use that as inspiration for structure and tone, not as a strict template.
3. Draft an improved README in-place for eufy-clean that:
   - Keeps all technical details and examples correct.
   - Improves organization and flow.
   - Uses concise, friendly language.
4. When you are done, ensure:
   - There are no code/logic changes in the repo (documentation-only diff).
   - The README still accurately describes the services, parameters, and project layout.

Finally:
- Summarize the changes you made to the README in a short list in your response.
- Confirm explicitly that you did not modify any logic or behavior in the code.
